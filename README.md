# Sublytical

A python-based webapp to get different analytical stats about a chosen subreddit. 

It's currently in early development.

I am working on this project in my spare time while studying software engineering part-time. 
For now, its mainly used to practice python and its web capabilities, getting a grasp about analytics and taking some early steps into the realm of machine learning.

I'd like to take the tool a step further if I reach a state where I'm confident, that it is of use for others too.
